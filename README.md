# My Story 

## Purpose
"My Story" is a platform designed to capture the essence of life's journey, particularly focusing on older generations. It provides a space for individuals to document snippets of their lives, share experiences, and impart wisdom. These stories are then transformable into unique, sharable URLs, creating a digital bridge between generations.

## Vision
To preserve the rich tapestry of human experiences by encouraging older people to share their life stories. The goal is to collect memories, challenges, and words of wisdom that can be cherished and accessed by friends, family, and future generations.

## Focus Areas
**Capturing Memories:** Encourage older users to write about significant events, daily life experiences, and personal challenges.

**Family Histories:** Document the process of building a family, the joys and hardships, and the lessons learned.

**Words of Wisdom:** Provide a platform for older generations to share their wisdom and advice on various topics, from life lessons to practical tips.
